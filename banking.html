					<h2>The Bank of The West</h2>
					<p>A 40-year family interest in supporting agricultural and real estate
					lending. Through affiliate family interests, we’ve maintained this ap-
					proach – to regularly shake hands with every depositor relationship in
					whose trust we keep.
					</p>
					<p>The Bank of The West has been serving our customers since 1984.
					We started with one location in Thomas, OK, and through the years
					we have grown to include three more locations. Our bank
					currently has four conveniently-located offices in Thomas, Clinton,
					Leedey, and Oklahoma City. The Bank of The West is a full service,
					community-minded financial center providing both personal and
					business checking accounts, savings accounts, Certificates of Deposit,
					and IRA accounts, as well as several types of consumer and commercial
					loans to its customers in those areas.
